       "0  in this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a behavioral response has been proposed a neural circuit can be thought of as a directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse it has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that circuit behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients of the fast fourier transform fft over the output spike train those coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space behavioral dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined the neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of existing memory synaptic plasticity and feelings the model has an analogy in classical electrostatics by which the notion of force and potential energy has been introduced since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and produces a behavior as the output it would be extremely difficult or may even be impossible to implement but with the help of the model a possible explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain has been offered the model is compatible with a recent model of sequential behavioral dynamics the model is based on electrophysiology but its relevance to hemodynamics has been outlined   \n",
